# Testing       

When we are talking about software development there is one main important topic that we need to cover, testing.

Testing it is a strategy to ensure that our code is doing what we expected, and also that in future changes all the old functionalities keep working in the same way.

# Getting Start

In order to start with testing with react there are several approaches, in this repository we are going to talk about the next stack:

- Jest
- Enzyme

To start doing testing in react we need to install react with npx

```sh 
npx create-react-app name app
```

After run the above command we can run our test running the next commands

```sh
npm run test
```
